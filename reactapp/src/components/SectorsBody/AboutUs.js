                    <span>impact initiative emerges, created from the collective effort of a group</span><br />
                    <span>of committed students from the MigraCode-Open Cultual Center programming</span><br />
                    <span>bootcamp. This vision arose from a deep desire to extend a hand of solidarity</span><br />
                    <span>to Ukrainian refugees from the war, facing the painful journey of settling</span><br />
                    <span>in a new city and adapting to a radically different culture and language.</span><br />
