    question: "Where can I go to find emergency/short-term housing?",   
    answer:   "The Spanish government provides refugees from Ukraine with housing. An application can be submitted to one of the centers for helping refugees from Ukraine or the hotline numbers: +34 91 399 00 09. More often, Ukrainians are accommodated in hotels, hostels, or dormitories, and they are also provided with food. You can live here until the refugees find work and can rent something on their own. Also, the Spaniards are ready to shelter Ukrainians in their homes; the offers are collected on Prykhystok portal. You can contact one of the reception, care, and referral centers for people displaced from Ukraine (CREADE). There you will be able to spend the night for several days, receive financial and legal assistance, as well as help in submitting documents for obtaining temporary protection."

    question: "What do I need in order to enter Spain?",
    answer: "Ukrainian nationals do not need to apply for a visa to enter Spain, and they are entitled to move freely within the EU for a period of 90 days. This allows them to choose the Member State where they want to enjoy their temporary protection rights and to join their relatives and friends who are resident in the European Union.If you are Ukrainian and you want to enter Spain but you do not have biometric passports or travel documents, you can go to a consular office in a country bordering Ukraine (e.g. Poland, Romania, Hungary, etc.) so your situation can be considered."
